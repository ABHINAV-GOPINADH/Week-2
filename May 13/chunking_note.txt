Chunking is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to group individual words into meaningful phrases or "chunks."
It bridges the gap between tokenization (breaking text into words) and full parsing (analyzing complete sentence structure).
Typically, chunking identifies phrases like noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), or prepositional phrases (PP).
This is often referred to as "shallow parsing" because it captures partial syntactic information.
Chunking relies heavily on part-of-speech (POS) tagging to detect patterns in sequences of words.
For example, a noun phrase might be identified as a sequence of an article followed by adjectives and a noun (e.g., "the big dog").
Regular expressions are frequently used to define these patterns for chunking.
It is useful in tasks like named entity recognition (NER), where named entities like people or locations are extracted.
Chunking simplifies downstream NLP tasks by reducing the complexity of syntactic structure.
It helps improve information retrieval, question answering, and text classification by capturing meaningful phrases.
In machine learning, chunking can be rule-based or trained on annotated datasets.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python provides built-in tools for chunking text data.
Modern NLP models like spaCy also include advanced chunking capabilities.
Chunking is language-dependent and requires careful consideration of grammar rules for different languages.
The output of chunking is typically a tree or bracketed structure showing phrases.
It enables higher-level semantic analysis and understanding of sentence components.
While not as detailed as full parsing, chunking offers a good balance between performance and linguistic accuracy.
In summary, chunking plays a critical role in extracting structured information from unstructured text.
